   abstract = {Due to the recent pandemic, air quality monitoring has seen a resurgence of interest, however, commercial equipment for environmental monitoring needs a considerable economic effort. In this project, a prototype of a meteorological and air quality monitoring system is developed and implemented. The validation of the system was conducted by comparing the energy consumption with the Gila station, a version used previously. The system is composed of a sensor node, a gateway, and an application server. Communication between the sensor node and the gateway is through the LoRaWAN low-power protocol and The Things Network (TTN) service is used for IoT integration. The system monitored meteorological and air quality variables using low-cost components and with low energy consumption and prolong its autonomous life thanks to an energy harvesting system.},
